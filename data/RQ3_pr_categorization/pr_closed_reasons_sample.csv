AP_HAL_Linux: added support for dynamic speed configration in LinuxSPIUARTDriver
[staroselskii @ 2015-04-24T10:28:52Z]: @tridge, sorry for trying to break travis once again. 
I'm not competent enough to reason about the nature of the experienced compiler bug. But the fix seems logical (knowing that such things did happen due to the lack of memory), doesn't it?  
[tridge @ 2015-07-01T00:00:35Z]: I don't think we should spam the console with these errors. If a USB serial device comes loose in flight then if we start writing these errors to the console rapidly we cause cause problems with scheduling.

With the current scaler, you don't have full 0.5 to 2.0 range (at leaste on my POTs) if the POT is centered when activated.  However, with this approach, you can increase the slider.  Deactivte the adjustment, slide the POT down, then reactive and slide up more to extend and get the full range.  I figure not having full range acts a little bit as a safety so I left it that way.

Generalize BigEndian serialization wrapper
It would be nice if the `SERIALIZE_METHODS` macro took a `class_name` argument. I'd like this so it'd be possible to add deserializing constructors here (like `CTransaction` has), so there could be a uniform way to deserialize objects without assuming they support default construction. But also a `class_name` argument would make the macro more flexible and future proof, so it'd be easy to do things like:

#2355097 0x00007ffff6c73f44 in QAbstractButtonPrivate::emitClicked() (this=0x1016cc1d0) at widgets/qabstractbutton.cpp:534

[sipa @ 2020-09-22T00:12:27Z]: I think you're confused. `MAX_GETDATA_SZ` doesn't stop processing; it only makes the request be split up into multiple GETDATA messages.

Right, I understand comments should be concerned with other transaction relay mechanisms.

I think there was an irc discussion a while back pointing that malicious inputs provoking collisions don't really matter as if your peer want to fail transaction announcement there is a reduction to stay silent.

The above **Watch Only Wallet now?** procedure is not ideal, but it is a way to have a watch-only wallet TODAY.  If you create such wallets offline, private keys are effectively never on the server.  This is the best, proven option you have for now.

Any tool (or NODE_ bit) that gives the users the ability to mitigate an eventual DoS attack would be welcomed by the community.

This is a true altruistic network, so I think people won't use these bits to discriminate peers.
[petertodd @ 2013-08-26T16:12:00Z]: A good example where the very different requirements of the different types of nodes matters is for anyone with a lot of bandwidth available to them, but not a lot of disk io or memory, a common scenario for servers in datacenters.
The most efficient way to push blocks over the wire for such a server would be to use sendfile() to do a direct copy from the blockchain data on disk to the network interface - behind the scenes Linux will use direct zero-copy DMA transfers of the data from the disk interface to the network interface, or system memory to the network interface, using almost no CPU in the process. On the other hand that means the blocks have to be sent unfiltered, which is fine if my peer needs the whole block. This arrangement uses the resources I have available most efficiently for the sake of the network.

It's a very limited form of type checking, and not nearly as useful as it could be in a much better designed language. But it is an improvement over the status quo for existing script.

Again, I'm just not seeing the value of things like ""type checkers"" for the scripting language right now, given how utterly simple it is. Equally, in the future if the choice was to make the scripting language more or less complex for the sake of _type checking_ vs. getting consensus, I'd 100% choose the latter, always. People are free to write scripts that are bad ideas; the important thing is that the consensus critical codebase stay simple to ensure we don't make mistakes that affect everyone. (like the one I made above!)

[gmaxwell @ 2015-04-10T14:34:38Z]: The primary reason is because the kernel has repeatedly screwed it up too on various systems, both due to OS bugs (e.g. recent Netbsd and Freebsd examples) and because of things like running in virtual machines where the environment was just too deterministic.  These are not hypothetical problems, but have been observed in practice and recently too.
The argument he gives applies more broadly then some might think, by that argument you'd generate a random state once and store it on disk, and just use that state... but this is clearly crazy because it's obvious that the data on disk has a different security exposure than data elsewhere. The same is otherwise true.   We do already avoid using 'new randomness' where it makes sense to avoid it because it can't buy us anything-- e.g. in signing.

RCTDevSettings provides all the interaction with the bridge and the rest of the app's runtime. RCTDevSettingsDataSource is the backing store for RCTDevSettings and is used to get/set values by RCTDevSettings. It should **not** alter values itself and try to update the devsettings (data flows only in one way). RCTDevMenu and our websocket (RCTDevConnection?) make use of RCTDevSettings: they get information from dev settings and write commands to it to alter state. Through that interface RCTDevSettings can decide to persist any settings using its RCTDevSettingsDataSource.

As the `TextInput` component has evolved, it can more or less be used as a drop-in replacement on iOS by setting `multiline={true}` and `editable={false}`. Except for one detail: the text input field has scrolling activated and it's not possible to turn off. (See #1391 and #15962).

- Are required using standard paths and have a .platform.js subextension
This is the next step in moving RN towards standard path-based requires. All the requires in `Libraries` have been rewritten to use relative requires with a few exceptions, namely, `vendor` and `Renderer/oss` since those need to be changed upstream. This commit uses relative requires instead of `react-native/...` so that if Facebook were to stop syncing out certain folders and therefore remove code from the react-native package, internal code at Facebook would not need to change.

The flow error wasn't occurring within the react-native code, but rather in some code that uses react-native.

With general engineering CAD tools defined above, I don't think that commercial CAD software worth tens of thousands of dollars can be considered a toy because it doesn't have some unmaintained workbenches, each offering a single tool for a very specific purpose. Besides, nobody wants to remove those functionalities from FreeCAD. Just not show them by default since, let's face it, a very small percentage of users will ever need them. Or move them to another workbench so that functionality remains the same and FreeCAD is no dumber. This software has its quirk that the most important and useful tools are add-ons while the least useful ones are built-in. Fortunately, it's starting to change in current releases. We got rid of some redundant workbenches and tools that nobody used but they were included by default for some reason.
A code limitation shouldn't force itself on the UI imo. Is there no way for a module to load a general menu rather than be a separate workbench? Yes there might be more inspection tools later, I can see how a workbench would then make sense, but it is not the case and the workbench has been around for 12+ years. So what is the likelyhood that it will never happen?

I'd rather create another PR to replace this one with fixes included to not risk that it will stay like this and fight with potential conflicts that can happen due to others fixing the same piece of code (which happened with #13571). That said, I also won't have time to do that until next saturday - after that I should have more time for FreeCAD.

Which is why I initially talked about making all controls expose ""contracts"" for the theme items they accept. So it's a control-side logic, not a global singleton logic. Or if it is a global singleton, I'd prefer a declarative way to interact with it (like `get_property_list`) instead of `ThemeSingleton->add_type`.

For purity, safe buffer size would be context size * (**max** token length). There is no guarantee that it's smaller than 4096, which is an unnamed constant you use multiple times. But it's not clear that such purity is needed. In fact, I am not sure even sure that flushing after max tokens vs max bytes (which would have a much simpler implementation) is a right approach.

> I don't understand what that additional check does (`max(self.move_d, prev_move.move_d) < 99999999.9 * cos_theta_d2`). At first glance though, it seems like that code would ""round up"" to higher junction speeds where I think we really want to ""round down"" in unusual corner cases like this.

is mostly right, however not entirely. The problem at hand is that as the segmentation for a curve becomes finer and finer, the angle between consecutive segments becomes closer and closer to 180 degrees (and cos(theta/2) approaches 0). And so, the current mainline Klipper code has an issue: it has a minimum limit for cos(theta/2), and thus technically produces incorrect results for angles theta very close to 180 degrees, both for consecutive straight segments and for very small segments forming a curve. Adjusting the limit  (e.g. setting it to -0.999999999999) just pushes the problematic cases further down the line. My approach is based on the following observation: for smooth curves, as the segmentation becomes finer, both move_d and cos(theta/2) go to 0, but their ratio does not (it does not go to either 0 or infinity), as limit(move_d / cos(theta/2)) = 2 * R. Thus, by checking the ratio move_d / cos(theta/2), we can tell apart the cases ""a curve with finite curvature, just very fine""and ""(sufficiently) straight segments"" regardless of how fine the segmentation is, and without having to play with limits too much, and apply the junction velocity limits from centripetal acceleration only to the first case. You could still say that the code contains a threshold, but the behavior of the code does not depend on its value too much, basically if the threshold is sufficiently large, it won't matter how large exactly it is. This is not the case for junction_cos_theta, as for any threshold you could choose sufficiently small segmentation that would make code produce technically incorrect junction velocity limits.

[sjasonsmith @ 2024-04-21T17:05:55Z]: I've always pictured HOTEND_OFFSET to be widely used on dual extruders with fixed offsets between two nozzles. This would include SWITCHING_NOZZLE configurations.
[DerAndere1 @ 2024-04-21T21:28:33Z]: I guess so far SWITCHING_TOOLHEADS was a very specific and obscure feature. With this PR it can be used in much more scenarios, including tool carousels (with minor additions). In my fork I can have a mix of Extruders and non-extruder tools, making the feature even more attractive. In general I suspect that many people try to change nozzles and beds and then struggle with setting the offsets in Marlin. People that have not worked with traditional CNC machines likely rely on features built into the printer's display UI. An official guide that documents best practive is missing for Marlin. So they try whatever is available. This leads to problems or confusing- and manual workflows (babystepping, home offset, G92....). People that know traditional CNC probably see Marlins limitations and just make sure their hardware does not need hotend offsets, or they quickly write their own toolchange algorithm instead of fixing the verrrry confusing existing toolchange.cpp

[endrift @ 2015-07-21T06:08:47Z]: All of this code already exists in other places. I can vaguely understand the desire to have it all in one file and then have the preprocessor take care of it, but it's a needless duplication of code. At worst, you can use the preprocessor to include the individual files, i.e.
...but there's a reason these directories exist in the first place. Since the goal is to support as many platforms as possible, you should probably just include each file in the Makefile as needed, as determined by the compilation target.
Besides, I'm not using PSL1GHT (which islikely what you would be able to obtain 'legally', and it's just a ripoff of the PS3 SDK anyway so it's not like it's any more 'legal' really than what it's derived from) for the RA PS3 port, so there's nothing you'd be able to bring here to the table that I haven't already done for you here in these commits. You're still dealing with the same ancient GCC compiler which still doesn't respond well to anon unions/structs, there's no getting around that.

For the non-GIL threading case, it seems reasonable that two threads shouldn't be allowed to concurrently mutate a dictionary's keys. Enforcing that without a mutex seems hard though. I feel that conceptually the globals dict and, say, the locals dict of a class or an actual dict object in users code should have different rules. Maybe in non-GIL threading mode, we need to do special protection of just globals dicts?

Yes, it already has a version number, and it should also have some flags indicating architecture and/or bytecode type.
And then the plan would be to use "".mpc"" files to contain not only persistent bytecode, but also persistent native/viper code, inline assembler, as well as dynamic loadable C modules #583.  This might seem like trying to stuff a lot into one file, but it's actually quite natural, and means the user doesn't need to worry/know about all the different kinds of dynamically loadable content.
Agree it's ambitious, but I think we should try in this case!  It will be a good outcome if we get it right.  The whole project is anyway in a state of flux :)  We need to have the liberty to make changes, else we can't improve.

Yeah, we could enable chinese reminder theorem or similar optimizations in axTLS, which were conservatively disabled to save code size (just for esp8266, unix should have enough power to crunch numbers ;-)).

Fixes issue #4182.

The modem sleep while connected to an AP is most likely a sleep between DTIMs from the AP, which usually come every 100ms (so sleep for about 95ms, wake for 5ms to turn on modem and receive).  So it would introduce a latency in reception of an Ethernet frame of up to 100ms.  You can try pinging the device while it's doing this DTIM sleep to see how it responds.
I also tried turning both AP and Station off. Ping fails, so it is going to sleep. But sometimes doing this results in a hard reset. Perhaps others can confirm/deny on reference hardware.
I'll re-test in a day or two when my reference boards become free.

If the esp32 was the only port then it'd be the obvious choice to make it `Pin.hold(value)`.  But there are lots of ports, and the decision whether ""hold"" could go in Pin or not would be based on how generic it could be, whether any other port may want also to have this functionality.  Even given that it'd go in Pin I still think it would be better to be an argument to the constructor/init because that's how other configuration values are done (eg alt, pull, mode).

- In an RTOS system, in order to unblock a VM thread to cause it to run a soft-IRQ some RTOS-provided function needs to be called in order to end that thread's wait condition. This implies that it was somehow determined that no VM thread is runnable and that some VM thread was selected for wake-up.
- Deep-sleep, as defined by a mode where execution state is lost and wake-up is similar to a reset, is different, all that is really needed is a function that ""cuts the power"" so to speak.

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing just after pushing this.  Ideally it'd be like codeformat and then you just don't need to think about how the formatting should be (especially coming from other projects, where commit msgs are different).

It's also possible that `mem_base` had a bad value in it because it was written to before the cache was disabled.  In that case the test would be testing a random memory range, not SDRAM.  So that could be why it was slow.

More specifically, it seems that `SCB_DisableDCache()` local variables must Not be kept on the stack (which happens with `O0`) otherwise it seems unpredictable. Note that `SCB_DisableDCache()` is force inlined and `sdram_test()` is `O0` which makes it use the stack for local variables. I would say change the optimization level, but not sure if it will perform the exact same test with any other level, but it also fixes the issue:

IMO it makes sense to remove these frozen modules and make them part of the ROMFS, because then they are fully configurable by the user.  At the moment unfortunately we don't have a way to provide default ROMFS filesystems.  If we did then we could just bundle a pre-made ROMFS with the 512k esp8266 firmware and retain the same set of included modules, they just moved from frozen to ROMFS.

Tying it into the UI directly also creates a problem where, should the end result not be merged, that it would need to be reworked from the ground up for it to properly function.

[pkviet @ 2023-06-06T09:37:30Z]: > How difficult do you think it would be to provide API's for plugins to implement such windows? Looking at the code it seems that’s basically what it does already, albeit internally via proc handlers. (And also, having the main obs-ffmpeg plugin link against Qt is going to be very controversial, I’d argue that _if_ this should become part of OBS itself it should be a UI feature instead, at which point you’d need the same API's a plugin would use).

3) personally I don't need different channel setups for different outputs though I could understand that for some users this is desireable for bandwidth saving (e.g. record in 5.1, stream in 2.0); twitch or FB live can ingest multichannel audio through rtmp (june 2017) and downmix it so (dependent on the streaming  service) multichannel streaming is not such a big concern for those having large bandwidth.  A per output speaker setup complicates the coding because it involves core functionalities so my preference would be not to implement such feature (and since Jim seems OK with not implementing that, which is a relief).

That's [here](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/ECH-draft-13c/test/recipes/95-test_external_ech_bssl.t) and seems to work - comments are welcome. Next step is to do some kind of split into ECH server, client and extras that could each be a separate PR.

What side-effects were you thinking of particularly? Note that `tls_collect_extensions` doesn't really do that much. It just parses the extensions at a coarse level and figures out which ones we've got. It doesn't process any of those extensions - that happens later.

By the commit subject, I would think that you are doing more drastic global changes for the subtarget not just GL-MV1000.
Also, on a sidenote. I wonder what to do with Meraki devices, which store calibration data in an UBI volume, currently detected by name in userspace - perhaps we need another dynamic parser for them. For MR33 that would be easy, as it has a copy in raw section of flash as well, but MR18 - for example - does not.

one of my problems is different, on my system I build openwrt on a drive mounted with NFS, and one side or the other has some bug related to permissions errors. Sometimes, when requesting a large amount of files deleted, it fails on a small group of them. They delete if you simply try again. I consider this not a big deal to leave 1-5 files hanging behind so I made the rule a non-fatal error with the `-` prefix.

@meshula I have been trying to integrate the material datalibrary referencing concept that was introduced in MaterialX. See [PR 2054](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/pull/2054) 
In our internal testing this has shown improvements in document load time.  Datalibrary referencing is not a required change for USD-Mtlx 1.39.x integration, the import based based workflow is still available in MaterialX.

[meshula @ 2025-03-13T21:29:14Z]: I'm very curious about why GL style fixed function parameters are passed here? In general wouldn't you just want a blit to a target? Fancy compositing really seems like something in the app domain and something an app could take care of in window/widget composition. ie, the viewport widget could just draw a textured quad, as opposed to trying to set up Hydra to do something a bit fancy? Minimally could we at least also have a not-fancy plain old blit? This set up seems like something I wouldn't want to have to deal with in my own apps, for example.

To put things into perspective, `DirtyInit` is there to prevent a relatively minor (dozens of microseconds) performance overhead of redoing `BuildAnonymizedMaterialNetwork`, which is necessary to produce the input for codegen and to compute the material hash. Without it, `BuildAnonymizedMaterialNetwork` would be called once before launching a parallel task, and then again, with the same inputs, when syncing the prim. The purpose of `HdSt_MaterialFilterTask` is to persist the result of the first call to `BuildAnonymizedMaterialNetwork` till material prim sync.

[ppenenko @ 2025-10-14T19:59:27Z]: One important change from the original implementation is that the generator task now gets a shared pointer to the filter task and holds on to it. The generation process reads some material network data which is part of the filter task, so it's important to ensure that it's not destroyed before codegen is complete. In the original implementation, the sprim held ownership of the filter task for the duration of codegen.

I'll probably also skip the wait_until_empty() thing. Not because I don't think it is useful. The main idea of having this repo was to have a base implementation that lends itself well to adaptation. Adding features like this opens it to a whole can of worms though: why don't we have a way to insert barriers then? dependencies? priorities?... :). If there is an argument here why this specific feature is ""more fundamental"" I'm open to adding it. Othewise I'm just happy keeping it in one of the many specialized forks though.

```","[bstiq @ 2021-09-11T21:17:13Z]: Note: might be nice to add back the keycode triggering sniping mode when held.
Namely `LAYOUT_kc`, which would automatically append `KC_` to whatever was in the keymap (eg `A` turned to `KC_A`).  While, this makes it more visually appealing and simpler to read, it means that every keycode you use *has* to start with `KC_`.  Which means that new users would often get tripped up as to why it was failing to compile.  Frequently.  Which basically dumps the onus of support on us.

update github.install.bat: fix CI problem",,,Process Issues,0.85,"The PR was not merged because it bundles multiple unrelated changes into a single PR, violating good contribution practices. The PR contains at least 3 distinct fixes: 1) Fixing wcstoutf8 buffer overflow crashes, 2) Fixing setup dialog display issues with librime 1.7.3, and 3) Updating librime to 1.8.5 in CI and fixing CI errors.

For the templates this should be OK, but not sure about `Color` and `Vertex`, see [my comments here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/pull/1741#issuecomment-762838738). For colors I understand the motivation to declare compile-time constants. But probably no one needs `constexpr` in `sf::Vertex`, so it would be a trade-off of run vs. compile-time with yet unknown benefits, and similar thoughts would be applicable to many other SFML classes.

Regardless, I think that comparing `sf::VertexArray` to `sf::VertexBuffer` is a bit misguided/off-topic for this PR, the main comparison I'd like to have is between `sf::VertexArray` and `std::vector<sf::Vertex>`, as the former is just an inferior version of the latter IMHO.

I genuinely think that the OOP-centric direction/vision you hold is too extreme, OOP doesn't need to be the only paradigm a library follows, especially in situations like this one where the benefits are nonexistent and the drawbacks are real.

I have reported it already, DNSSEC support and validation are often not well explained. It was you, who said everything is clear and no change is needed. Yet you prove here it is not clear. DO bit means DNSSEC Okay. It signals client can understand DNSSEC RRSET and they can be sent to him. It should not be related in any way to validation status! It should depend only on upstream resolver's ability to provide DNSSEC records and pass them forward. With disabled validation or degraded validation. If it received DNSSEC records, pass them to client requesting them. Everytime. They may validate it themselves (like ``delv`` does).

I am not convinced the fallback should be merged. It is very much broken and there are known exploits as polkit has seen. I imagine this functionality will be used to authorize, among other things, loading block devices without privileges via systemd-backdoord - we really, really do not want to ship a broken authentication method for that, as it's pretty much a kernel-breaking escalation path. The pid fd method is safe and proven, and we can use it to ship this feature with confidence that it will work as expected (and if it doesn't, we can just blame the kernel VFS maintainer, easy)
No, I am saying that calling CheckAuthorization(pid, uid, start_time) is _not_ auth-by-id. auth-by-id or by-anything-else is decided when the policy rules are evaluated, and it's entirely orthogonal to which parameters are passed to this call.

> I am sorry, but please provide an example what kind of attack that passing just a pidfd to a peer is going to block that passing uid+pid+starttime is vulnerable to.

Anyway, not sure what I should do with this now. You are building security decisions on unsafe stuff (pidfd-derived cgroups info), and then are upset if I avoid it, and instead provide polkit with safe stuff (uid). I really don't think your usecase makes sense, but if you want to block this because of that broken usecase, then fine, I'll prep a new PR that does the systemd-creds without any polkit hookup and we can close this PR here, and not do polkit for the forseeable future.

The status is that polkit-124 is available in a stable Fedora version.

hence let's go the tail/awk way for translating the root partition type id for now, so that we can cover the current release of fedora sanely.

I think curation is necessary here, and sd-boot so far was about providing ""managed"" menu entries, that show high-level, predefined sets of configs (that is quite literally what type #1 boot loader spec stuff is all about after all: binding different choices together and turning them into menu items). This here is basically a way to make some of the power of type #1 available in type #2 so that we can properly sign/measure the combinations and allow them in SB lockdown mode, where the combinations of type #1 are not allowed.

Addons is a contradiction to the *unified* approach of UKIs of course, and I think it's fine, if we have really good reasons for this (i.e. coarse modulatory to cover for disk space issues,  different ownership of resources), but unless there's one of these strong reasons to have things split out I am very sure it should always be kept inside the UKI. 

[poettering @ 2015-06-26T15:58:40Z]: Hmm, what's the rationale for removing the ""the""? Sounds weird that way. I mean, it's really all the functions the man page describes that are included in the library?

Moreover, this enables optimizations in future: by having a meta-handle that clearly says ""resolve this via host root dir fd"", we can even optimize chase() calls to fallback to regular open() in many cases (this PR doesn't do this, but I think this would be really nice, since it would make straces a lot more readable; oh, and things would be faster too).

[lrusak @ 2022-12-29T17:34:15Z]: Or just convert it to milliseconds right away from minutes.
Different question: does it also work if you just return from AddPause() in case for Truehd and DD+ after the usleep?
Assumption as posted in other PR: android raw sink lower layer produces the pause frames itself.

Unfortunately, I must report that audio did not come back pausing and unpausing. I got nothing but silence. However, after seeking, audio does now indeed come back (most of the time). There were still some occasions where after seeking the audio came back, but ""intermittently"". Like it was cutting in and out and I had to seek again to make it work.

this is no still frame. VideoPlayer sets hints.stills when being in a menu which is wrong.
If hints.still is only set for individual frames and not for videos that play during menus, and codec gets close/opened between stills and videos then I think that would be fine to use software decode for the stills. Is this something VideoPlayer knows?

But I'm not sure if specifying architecture separate from the platform is a good idea because something might work on win32 x86_32, linux x86_32 and linux x86_64 but not on win32 x86_64 so separating the platform and architecture separately will result in wrong information.
