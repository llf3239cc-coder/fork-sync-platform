This implements the BIP324 v2 transport (which implements all of what the BIP calls transport layer *and* application layer), though in a non-exposed way. It is tested through an extensive fuzz test, which verifies that v2 transports can talk to v2 transports, and v1 transports can talk to v2 transports, and a unit test that exercises a number of unusual scenarios. The transport is functionally complete, including:

The idea is to fix the plugins rather than make the plugin's memory management a problem of the shutdown code in `src/daemon/plugin.c`. By adding a reference count, it doesn't matter in which order the various callbacks are shut down in the daemon code.
memory plugin: Use standard system metric names (OTEP #119)
format_json: Update `format_json_open_telemetry` to use resource metrics.
Load plugin: rewrite Linux implementation using `read_text_file_contents`.


ChangeLog: Daemon: Memory corruption in the ""label_set_delete"" function has been fixed.","src/daemon/metric_test.c: Test the integrity of `metric_label_set`.

Enable QNN EP weight sharing generation using public API instead of internal interfaces, so that user can integrate into their own toolchain. The change is to share the QnnBackendManager across ORT sessions if ep.share_ep_contexts is enabled.

Currently, the worker protocol has a version number that we increment whenever we change something in the protocol. However, this can cause a collision between Nix PRs / forks that make protocol changes (e.g. PR #9857 increments the version, which could collide with another PR). So instead, the client and daemon now exchange a set of protocol features (such as `auth-forwarding`). They will use the intersection of the sets of features, i.e. the features they both support.
